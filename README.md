### Welcome to my GitHub Development Page ðŸ‘‹


Hi, I'm Christo, a Java developer. I am an active investor, student, and programmer. I have been working with Java as well as 
the Spigot API for multiple years now. I have many notable accomplishments, such as two prison cores, as well as being the lead developer over
at Gamers React. 

I am a very easy individual to work with, and work for the success of my clients. I enjoy proposing ideas, and optimizing code to make the front end
experience the best that it can possible be. I really enjoy what I do, and I provide the highest quality of work.
